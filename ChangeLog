# 0.6.1

- Fixing documentation typos
- Implementing basic context merging (see
  <https://github.com/lymar/hastache/issues/31>)
- `mkGenericContext'` takes an additional `(String -> String)`
  argument which is applied to record field names, much like aeson's
  `fieldLabelModifier`
- Removing unnecessary `utf8-string` dependency

Thanks to: Tobias Florek, Edsko de Vries, Janne Hellsten, @clinty, and
others

# 0.6.0
